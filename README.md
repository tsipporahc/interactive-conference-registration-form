# interactive-conference-registration-form
 Techdegree Unit 3 Project

Get ready for the next Full Stack Conference!

About: This project was created to demonstrates my foundational knowledge in Javascript regular expressions, event listeners, DOM maniplation and functions. I programmed the functionality of this form with accessibility in mind. I created interactive dropdown and selection menus. The form validates user inputs and notifies users with a valid/invalid message upon submission of the form. This is the final project for Unit 3 of the Treehouse Techdegree Course.

Purpose: This is an interactive sign up form for a tech conference that validates user inputs, created to be accessibility to all users.

Challenges: My greatest roadblock was working through the functions for my validation tests. I learned the importance of declaring variables in the global/ local scope, and declaring variables outside of functions so that they can be accessed by other parts of the program too. 

Future Considerations: I hope in the future to add additional features to this form: prevent user from register for activities that have time-conflicts, real-time error message, and a conditional error, for different types of errors.
